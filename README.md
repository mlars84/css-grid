# CSS Grid Layout
- Having some cheesey fun while learning CSS-Grids. The website is sorta 90s and sorta halloween with emojis.

## Notes
- Shorthand for multiple autos: `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, auto);`
- Shorthand for `grid-row` start/end and `grid-column` start/end: `grid-row: startNumber/endNumber; aka grid-row: 1/3;`
- `grid-area` is basically short-hand for setting grid-column-start and grid-column-end.
